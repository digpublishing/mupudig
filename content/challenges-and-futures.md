This was my part of an extended webinar on “Digital Futures: New Directions in Art Librarianship”, organized by members of ARLIS/NA’s professional development committee. I identified and focused on three challenges:

1. Reticence (there’s not enough appetite or market)
2. Rights (it’s too hard to clear and manage image rights for digital publications)
3. Format (artworks don’t shine in the dominant e-book formats or devices)

And two futures:

1. Multiplicity (art publishers are carving many creative new paths forward)
2. Web-like (we’re in a position to move onto the web which will prove to be more dynamic, more open, and more universal)

*The webinar was recorded, and is available to ACRL members at https://acrllive.learningtimesevents.org/digital-futures/.*

## Description

Digital Humanities, Scholarly Publishing, Open Access, Born Digital Content, the Future of the Book: Each of these topics has vast ramifications on how libraries collect, maintain, and make available information. But how do these themes impact the subject or discipline-specific library? This session will focus on how art libraries are responding to the transition to digital scholarly publishing and born-digital content in ways that are important to the broader scholarly community. Moderated by a member of the ARLIS/NA Professional Development Committee, this 90-minute session will have three speakers, each whom will address the following themes: 

1. The Leading Edge: art and the digital humanities 
2. The Bleeding Edge: archiving born-digital art content 
3. The Trailing Edge: challenges of e-publishing in the arts 

Each speaker will illustrate how initiatives that are taking place in academic and museum art research institutions are not only innovative but can provide leadership and momentum for librarians in any field.
