## Talk Description

Driven by increasingly accessible self-publishing technology and a new cultural focus on auteurship, more photobooks are being published today than ever before. Outside photography, we have seen an explosion in books of another kind: e-books. Driven by the mass-adoption of mobile devices and the creation of file formats that work across those devices, the ongoing success of e-book publishing hinges on making books both mobile and flexible. This sometimes means rethinking what a photobook is. In this talk, we'll look at the industry dominant e-book formats, and what they can and cannot do, today and into the future, for photography.
