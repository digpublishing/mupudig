## Panel Description

In museums today, we employ user-centered design practices while developing projects to define our audiences and align with their needs. All too often, though, we lack the time and resources to do the equally valuable post-launch work of user-centered evaluationâ€”work that could take us from the theoretical to the practical by shedding light on who actually uses these projects, and how. This knowledge is especially critical in cases where content design methodologies span multiple projects, or even multiple institutions, as in the growing field of online collection catalogue publishing. This session presents the findings of an ambitious evaluation of online scholarly catalogues produced by four museums: The Art Institute of Chicago, the J. Paul Getty Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the National Gallery of Art. The study, conducted by Rockman et al, draws upon evaluation of web analytics, user surveys, and in-depth user testing and focus groups. By addressing questions such as how the digital publications compare to scholarly works in print, what platforms and features create the best experience, and how the digital interface facilitates engagement with museum collections, it aims to close the gap between the audiences we plan for, and those we are truly serving.
