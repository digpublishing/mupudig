Part of a panel titled “Moving Forward by Looking Sideways: Creative Thinking in Museum Digital Strategy”, chaired by Sarah Hromack and Erica Gangsei.

## Panel Description

In this panel and working session, museum  professionals will be encouraged to seek out new methodologies for museum engagement by  looking not to one another in the field but beyond  to a growing number of online initiatives whose goals and ideals may speak to the museum mission more closely than meets the eye. By considering expertise that isn’t directly rooted in museum culture, we remain open to the creative possibilities that emerge from non-institutional work environ-ments. This session seeks to expand our collective pool of knowledge and resources – and to broaden our thinking therein.
