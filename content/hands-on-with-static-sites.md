## Workshop Description

Going back more than a quarter century to the first days of the web, websites were originally delivered as simple, flat HTML files. In the years that followed, the demand for more interactive, flexible and data-driven websites increased, and we became reliant on increasingly complicated backend server architectures that would deliver customized pages and sites on the fly. However, proving that everything old is new again, the past several years has seen a renaissance in flat-file delivery, powered by a new class of modern web tool: static-site generators. Static-site generators are software designed to take plain-text content and media assets, feed it through a set of customized templates, and output a website as a packaged set of HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that can be hosted on virtually any webserver with no special setup.

There are now dozens of different static-site generators available, they're virtually all open source, and they can be configured to make just about any kind of website. The Carnegie Museum of Art builds its collection pages with Middleman, the Australian Centre for the Moving Image created an open source audio-tour package with Jekyll, and now the Getty has an open source digital publishing tool, Quire, built on Hugo. In this workshop, participants will get hands on with the Getty’s Quire.

As a digital publishing tool, static-site generators allow us to publish in multiple formats, decrease dependencies and maintenance issues and thereby increase site longevity, and keep source content in a human-readable format; all while still offering features like interactive maps, deep zoom images, audio and video, and more. While we’ll use Quire as a framework, the fundamental tools and approaches involved are directly applicable to other major static-site generators as well. Participants will learn static-site basics including: How to get up and running with basic command line tools; converting and editing content in Markdown and YAML (the two plain-text workhorses of the static-site world); the basic manipulation of CSS styles, and construction of page templates and partials or includes; and site deployment via FTP or GitHub pages.
