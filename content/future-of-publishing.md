Part of the 2010 Flair Symposium (‚ÄúShaping the History of Photography‚Äù) and a panel on Photographic Publishing, this was my very first talk. [Mary Virginia Swanson](https://mvswanson.com/) invited me to participate and for that I‚Äôll always be grateful to her as it was not only a lovely event, but also opened my eyes to the idea that this was the kind of thing I could do.

My first foray into public speaking suffered some from my misguided desire in the slides and script to come off as more clever than necessary, and were video available, you would have seen me shaking like a leaf as I doggedly and not always successfully worked through script. Still, it‚Äôs not half bad.

My vision for the future of publishing was twofold. The first half of the talk focuses on the collaborative publishing process model that was core to the way I was running (or trying to run) Hol Art Books. The second half focuses on the democratizing and expanding possibilities of e-books. 

Ten years later, both ideas remain sound if not also fully realized.
