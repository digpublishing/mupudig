## Talk Description

Greg Albers, the Digital Publications Manager at Getty Publications, discusses the shifting fundamentals of book publishing, from setting lead type, to coding and the command line, while considering some key questions and diving into some practical applications. What are the few fundamental ideas we think authors and others should learn? What tools or lessons can we provide to get them there? Whatâ€™s at stake and where will we go from here?
