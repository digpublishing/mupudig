I gave the keynote and then afterward moderated a roundtable on publishing.

## Talk Abstract

From clay tablet to scroll to codex, the history of publishing can be seen through the lens of technology disruption, followed by hand wringing, experimenting from the fringes, revelation and finally, integration. These early days of digital publishing are no different. We have already seen promising signs of experimentation as authors and publishers alike have sought novel new approaches in both creating and disseminating their work with the powerful new tools put before them. But to bridge the gap from rule-breaking one-off projects to a sound and lasting publishing methodology, we must expand the conversation and collectively work to better understand and control the tools and materials we are working with, namely code. More than facility with specific languages, a deeper understanding of the fundamental qualities of code, may give us the framework and vocabulary necessary to break more rules better, and to find our way to the future of publishing together. The only danger is in going so far in breaking assumptions about a publication that the end result isn't one. So, just as critical as understanding what code is and what it can be, is a similarly meaningful understanding of the fundamental qualities of what makes a book a book, or a journal a journal, so as we continue to experiment, we're sure to break just the right things.
