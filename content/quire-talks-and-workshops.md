Quire is the open source, multiformat publishing software we’ve been developing at Getty. In conjunction with conferences, I’ve done a number of workshops (3–4 hours), demos and talks (1 hour), and lightning presentations (10–20 minutes) presenting Quire and getting people up and running and testing it out for use in their own publishing projects.

Quire is currently in private beta but you can get access by filling out the form at https://bit.ly/quire-beta.
